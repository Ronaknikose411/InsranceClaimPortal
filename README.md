Claims Management System
Project Overview
The Claims Management System is a web application designed to streamline the process of filing, tracking, and managing insurance claims. It offers a user-friendly interface for both policyholders and customer service representatives, allowing for efficient claim submission, status tracking, and customer support through a chatbot.

Key Features
Claim Submission:

Users can file claims by providing essential information such as policy number, incident date, claim type, and a description of the incident.
Each claim is assigned a unique claim number for easy tracking.
Claim Status Tracking:

Users can search for their claims using the unique claim number or policy number to check the status of their submissions.
Knowledge Base:

Provides detailed information about various insurance policies, including health, auto, home, travel, life, and liability insurance.
Users can download PDF policy documents directly from the application.
Chatbot Integration:

A chatbot feature offers users instant assistance by answering frequently asked questions and providing information on claims and policies.
The chatbot can extract claim and policy numbers from user input to facilitate claim status inquiries.
Responsive Design:

The application is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal user experience across devices.
Technologies Used
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web application.
JavaScript: For implementing interactive features and handling user input.
DOM Manipulation: For dynamically updating the UI based on user actions.
JSON: For storing claims data in memory (can be extended to use a database).
